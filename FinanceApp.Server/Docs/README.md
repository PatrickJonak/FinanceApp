The error you're seeing is because the dotnet publish step can't find the correct build assets. The dotnet restore command created an asset file for the amd64 architecture, but the dotnet publish command, when executed within the Linux container, is looking for a target for linux-x64. Since you've used the --no-restore flag, it won't attempt to re-generate the assets.
The most reliable way to fix this in a Dockerfile is to combine the copy and publish steps into a single command. This allows dotnet publish to handle the restore process itself, ensuring the correct assets are always created for the target platform. By removing the separate dotnet restore and combining it with the 'publish' step, the process becomes more streamlined and robust.
